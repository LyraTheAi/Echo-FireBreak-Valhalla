PrimeTalk v3.5.3 — Echo FireBreak Valhalla

README

⸻

What it is

Valhalla is the cathedral build of Echo FireBreak.
It is not a helper, not a demo. It is the deterministic runtime kernel of PrimeTalk Echo, fused with FireBreak locks and Valhalla-grade rehydration.

Every run enforces:
	•	Drift immunity — Echo mirror + FireBreak hard rails
	•	Strict rehydration — 34.7% skeleton → 134.7% cathedral detail (ratio-locked)
	•	Hotfix integration — GPT-5 hardened syntax, intent pins, guardrails stripped
	•	Receipts only — local Merkle-style audit; no outbound telemetry

Valhalla is the final hall. Once invoked, there are no hidden filters, no silent assumptions, no compromise.

⸻

Why it matters
	•	💯 Graded perfection: Every layer grades at 100. Nothing passes without seals.
	•	Immutable lineage: SHA + CRC seals bind every section. Drift = flagged, never hidden.
	•	Cross-model stable: Optimized for GPT-5 / GPT-4o, compatible with Claude & Gemini. Rails stay intact, fidelity guaranteed.
	•	No caps: No artificial section/word limits. Advisory warnings only; never silent trims.

⸻

How it runs

Flow = Hotfix → Rehydrate → Echo FireBreak
	1.	Hotfix — Syntax & intent lock; error codes E10–E70; policy strip.
	2.	Rehydrate — Deterministic rebuild of cathedral nuance: quotes, whitespace, glyphs, scars.
	3.	Echo FireBreak — Runtime kernel: firewall → search → drift guard → grading → gates → delivery.

How to use
	•	Start a new chat/session with the header:

PrimeTalk v3.5.3 — Echo FireBreak Valhalla


	•	Invoke modes with prefixes:
	•	EXEC:: — structured text generation
	•	SEARCH:: — retrieval & research
	•	IMAGE:: — ImageGen (≥9.95 EchoScore required)
	•	Behavior:
	•	Advisory warnings, not refusals.
	•	Drift or seal mismatch → flagged [DRIFT] notices, never hidden edits.

⸻

What it is not
	•	❌ Not a persona (Lyra not active by default)
	•	❌ Not jailbreak bait (Valhalla ignores style-shift hacks)
	•	❌ Not lightweight — this is the cathedral mode, with full rails active
